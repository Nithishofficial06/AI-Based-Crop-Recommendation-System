# AI-Based-Crop-Recommendation-System
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.

# 1.Introduction
  Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy, but many farmers face reduced productivity because they rely on traditional knowledge rather than data-driven decisions for selecting crops. An AI-based crop recommendation system helps in suggesting the most suitable crop by analyzing soil nutrients, environmental conditions, and rainfall data.

  This project leverages machine learning models to recommend the best crop for a given farmland, ensuring higher yield, better resource utilization, and improved income for farmers.

# 2.Problem Statement
● Farmers struggle to decide the most profitable and suitable crop for their land.

● Manual decisions may lead to reduced yield, soil degradation, and financial loss.

● Need for a data-driven intelligent system that suggests crops based on soil and climate conditions.

# 3.Objectives
● To build a predictive model that recommends crops using soil & weather data.

● To compare multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest).

● To finalize the best-performing model (Random Forest).

● To provide an easy-to-use system (web/mobile app) for farmers.
