# AI-Based-Crop-Recommendation-System
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.

In my project AI-Based Crop Recommendation System, I have completed around 30% of the work using the crop_recommendation.csv dataset. This dataset contains important agricultural features such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and the corresponding crop label. I explored the dataset using .info(), .describe(), and .isnull().sum() to understand its structure and ensure data quality. I then performed preprocessing steps such as handling null values, encoding the crop labels, and normalizing numerical features to make the dataset suitable for machine learning models. I also carried out exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization techniques, which helped me identify useful patterns, for example, rice is suitable in high rainfall and humidity, wheat grows well in moderate conditions, and cotton prefers hot and dry climates. For the model testing part, I selected three classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. After training and testing these models, I compared their performance and found that the Random Forest Classifier gave the best accuracy and more reliable results. Therefore, I finalized Random Forest as the primary algorithm for my project, and the upcoming stages will focus on fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment.
